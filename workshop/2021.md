# Overview

The International Workshop on Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC
(P3HPC) provides a forum for researchers and application developers to discuss
their successes and failures in tackling the compelling problems that lie at
the intersection of performance, portability and productivity (P3) and
High-Performance Computing (HPC).

We are particularly interested in research that addresses the complexities of
real-life applications and/or realistic workloads, the composibility challenges
arising from bespoke solutions, and the desire to "future-proof" applications
through an era of increased heterogeneity and new emerging architectures. The
topic of P3 touches on many aspects of HPC software development, and we expect
the workshop program to reflect a wide range of experiences and perspectives,
including those of compiler, language and runtime experts; performance
engineers; and domain scientists.

# Topics of Interest

Authors are invited to submit novel research from all areas concerned with
performance, portability, and productivity.  Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to:

- Extensions to HPC languages (e.g. C/C++, Fortran), libraries and runtimes
- Directives, libraries, domain-specific languages, and other abstractions
- Algorithmic and application development techniques
- Techniques specifically designed for use with legacy codes
- Impact of increasing complexity of workflows on P3 analysis
- Preparing applications for future architectural changes
- Measuring and evaluating the success of P3 approaches
- Case studies using state-of-the-art P3 tools and techniques (successes and failures)


Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and accepted papers are expected to be published by
the [IEEE Technical Consortium on High Performance Computing (TCHPC)][TCHPC] in
the [IEEE Xplore Digital Library][IEEEXplore].
