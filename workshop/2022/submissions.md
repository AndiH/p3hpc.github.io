# Submitting a Paper

Papers must be submitted electronically via
[Linklings](https://submissions.supercomputing.org).

Full papers are expected to be published in the IEEE Xplore digital archive in
collaboration with IEEE Computer Society.

## Important Dates

{% include_relative important_dates.md %}

## Requirements

Authors are invited to submit original papers of no more than 10 pages,
including tables, figures, and your appendices, but not including references
nor the reproducibility appendix.  Papers must be at least 6 pages long, not
including references and the reproducibility appendix.

All submissions should be formatted according to the [IEEE Conference
Proceedings
format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

## Reproducibility Appendix

The P3HPC workshop will follow a reproducibility initiative similar to SC
technical papers: authors are encouraged to include  an Artifact Description
(AD) and Artifact Evaluation (AE) appendix detailing available artifacts and
any steps taken to increase the trustworthiness of their results (see
https://sc22.supercomputing.org/submit/reproducibility-initiative/).

The nature of performance portability involves demonstrated performance across
multiple architectures, hence authors should describe artifact components
across all architectures employed, such as compiler, runtime and application
configurations.  Authors should clearly document and explain the reasoning
behind such configuration differences, to assist future researchers seeking to
reproduce their experiments on future architectures.
