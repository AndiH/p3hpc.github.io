# Submitting a Paper

Authors are invited to submit original papers for potential presentation as
part of the P3HPC workshop. Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and accepted
papers are expected to be published by
the [IEEE Technical Consortium on High Performance Computing (TCHPC)][TCHPC] in
the [IEEE Xplore Digital Library][IEEEXplore].

[TCHPC]: http://tc.computer.org/tchpc
[IEEEXplore]: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=P3HPC

Papers must be submitted electronically using the [SC21 submissions web
site](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=Submit&id=SC21WorkshopP3HPCAbstract&site=sc21).

## Important Dates

{% include_relative important_dates.md %}

## Requirements

- Papers may be at most 10 pages long, including tables, figures and
  appendices. References and the required Reproducibilty Appendix (see below)
  are not included in this maximum page count. Papers must be at least 6 pages
  long, not including references and the Reproducibility Appendix.

- Submissions must be formatted according to the IEEE Conference Proceedings
  format as implemented by the [IEEE Conference Proceedings Word and
  LaTex/BibTex templates][templates] (use “conference” mode with LaTeX).
  Authors must not change the template (e.g. to change fonts, spacing,
  margins).

## Reproducibility Appendix

The P3HPC workshop will follow a reproducibility initiative similar to the SC21
Technical Papers Reproducibilty Initiative: authors are encouraged to submit an
appendix of no more than two pages detailing available artifacts (software,
data, and documentation) and any steps taken to increase the trustworthiness of
their results.

The nature of performance portability involves demonstrated performance across
multiple architectures, hence authors should describe artifact components
across all architectures employed, such as compiler, runtime and application
configurations. Authors should clearly document and explain the reasoning
behind such configuration differences, to assist future researchers seeking to
reproduce their experiments on future architectures.

A reproducibility appendix template can be found [here][reproducibility].

## COVID-19

We are working closely with the SC organizers as they work through a safe and
effective means to hold workshops during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
