# Overview

The topic of Performance, Portability, and Productivity (P3) encompasses the
body of knowledge related to enabling applications and libraries to run across
multiple architectures without significant impact on achieved performance and
with the goal of maintaining developer productivity. The International Workshop
on Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC (P3HPC) provides a forum
for researchers and developers to discuss their successes and failures in
tackling the compelling problems that lie at the intersection of performance,
portability and productivity (P3) and High-Performance Computing (HPC). The
topic of P3 touches on many aspects of HPC software development and the
workshop program is expected to reflect a wide range of experiences and
perspectives, including those of compiler, language and runtime experts;
applications developers, performance engineers; and domain scientists.

Further information on the scope and expectations for P3HPC submissions may be
found [here](https://p3hpc.org/principles/).

# Topics of Interest

Authors are invited to submit novel research from all areas concerned with
performance, portability, and productivity.  Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to:

- Measuring and evaluating the success of P3 approaches with applications, proxy-apps, or benchmarks
- Portability oriented HPC languages, programming models, directives, libraries, domain-specific languages, runtimes, or other abstractions
- Case studies using state-of-the-art P3 tools and techniques (successes and failures)
- Algorithmic and application development techniques
- Techniques specifically designed for use with legacy codes
- Impact of increasing complexity of workflows on P3 analysis
- Preparing portable applications for future architectural and system changes, e.g. edge, federation
- Composability challenges arising from the use of bespoke solutions
- Future-proofing applications through an era of increased heterogeneity and new emerging architectures
