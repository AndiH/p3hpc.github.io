# About P3HPC

Performance, Portability, and Productivity in HPC (P3HPC) events provide an
opportunity for researchers and application developers to discuss their
successes and failures in tackling the compelling problems that lie at
the intersection of performance, portability and productivity (P3) in
High-Performance Computing (HPC).

We are particularly interested in research that addresses the complexities of
real-life applications and/or realistic workloads, the composibility challenges
arising from bespoke solutions, and the desire to "future-proof"  applications
through an era of increased heterogeneity and new emerging architectures. The
topic of P3 touches on many aspects of HPC software development, and attracts a
wide range of experiences and perspectives, including those of compiler,
language and runtime experts; performance engineers; and domain scientists.

## Workshop

The IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Performance, Portability and
Productivity in HPC (P3HPC) has been run as part of the Supercomputing (SC)
program since 2018.  Papers submitted to the workshop are peer-reviewed,
and accepted papers are published by the [IEEE Technical Consortium on High
Performance Computing (TCHPC)][TCHPC] in the [IEEE Xplore Digital
Library][IEEEXplore].

## Forum

The Performance, Portability and Productivity in HPC (P3HPC) Forum is an
outgrowth of a successful series of events hosted by the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) National Laboratories. Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley, Lawrence
Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Sandia National Laboratories all have
Centers of Excellence (COE) where computational scientists from the labs and
vendors partner to ensure that scientific applications can successfully use
current and next-generation supercomputers. The first DOE Centers of Excellence
Performance Portability Meeting was hosted in 2016; in 2020, its name was
changed to align with the P3HPC Workshop.

The Forum is designed to promote discussion and feedback. As such, submissions
range from preliminary results to completed studies previously published at a
prior conference or workshop, and take a variety of forms: technical
presentations; breakout sessions; panel discussions; and technical posters.
