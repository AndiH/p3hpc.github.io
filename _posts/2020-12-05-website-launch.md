Until this year, the P3HPC website has always been hosted on a domain
associated with a member of the program committee. Several attendees
requested a simpler way to keep track of all P3HPC-related news:
enter [p3hpc.org](https://p3hpc.org)!

If you encounter any bugs, or have any suggestions for how to improve
the website, please open an issue [on
GitHub](https://github.com/P3HPC/p3hpc.github.io).
