The program committee for the 2021 P3HPC Workshop have prepared a [draft document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wqOmoYlu9i4Oz6WU4yoe3SiGxgiP6Tdh_96qoM1lLCQ/edit#heading=h.ntp9sagxb8hb) in an attempt to establish the key shared principles and expectations shared by all members of the P3HPC community, and capture the remaining sources of disagreement.  Readers are encouraged to leave comments and suggestions directly in the document, or to contact members of the P3HPC commitee via e-mail.  The principles will also be [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qckSz4lNxtjz4UQGmaX-x1Fct1xVVrwD/edit#slide=id.p1) and discussed during the _Healing the Gaps and Growing the Scope of Performance, Portability and Productivity_ panel that closes this year's P3HPC workshop on November 14.
